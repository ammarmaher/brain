# PRD Index

> **PRDs are the upstream source** that feeds Business rules, Validation rules, Pages, Components, and Backend services. Brain Outputs holds the analysis; this hub holds the graph.

## Aggregate coverage

- **185 PRD↔code gap rows** across all modules
- **69 COVERED** · **21 PARTIAL** · **45 MISSING** · **42 UNVERIFIABLE**
- **Effective measurable rows:** 185 − 42 = 143
- **Coverage overall:** 69 / 143 = **48.3 %**
- **Coverage + partial:** 90 / 143 = **63.0 %**

## How PRDs connect to everything else

| PRD module → links to | Why |
|---|---|
| [[BUSINESS_INDEX]] | Every PRD module has `BUSINESS_RULES.md` — those rules promote into per-page `BUSINESS_RULES.md` in `understanding/pages/` |
| [[VALIDATION_INDEX]] | Validation rules sit inside PRD `WORKFLOWS.md` + `BUSINESS_RULES.md` — they promote into per-page `VALIDATION_RULES.md` |
| [[API_INDEX]] | PRD entities + workflows determine API contracts in `understanding/backend/<service>/ENDPOINT_REGISTRY.md` + `DTO_DICTIONARY.md` |
| [[FRONTEND_INDEX]] | PRD `OVERVIEW.md → Main Screens` lists which pages render the module. Page notes in `10-Pages/` cite their implementing PRDs back. |
| [[COMPONENT_INDEX]] | PRD screens drive Falcon component choice. Component notes carry "PRDs that use this component" back-links. |
| [[GAPS_INDEX]] | Each PRD module has `GAPS.md` enumerating PRD↔code gaps. The roll-up sits at `PRD_GAP_SUMMARY.md`. |
| [[EVIDENCE_INDEX]] | PRD attachments (Sheets, Drive Drawings, supporting docs) are the original evidence behind every rule. |

## Trigger phrases for PRD operations

| Phrase | Action |
|---|---|
| "take latest from PRD" | Run the `prd-knowledge` skill → re-sync all 6 modules from Drive → re-extract rules/entities/workflows/gaps/questions |
| "what PRDs cover Organization Hierarchy?" | List PRDs implementing that page (from [[01 Account Management]] in this case) |
| "show validation gaps in PRD 03" | Open `Brain Outputs/prd/modules/03-.../GAPS.md` filtered by category |
| "what PRDs use Falcon Data Table?" | Filter PRD module screens → those rendering tables → cite the component back-link section in [[Falcon Data Table]] |

## Stale-check rule

- 14-day re-sync threshold from PRD-knowledge skill.
- Last sync: 2026-04-24. **Current age: 21 days** as of 2026-05-15 — **STALE**. Recommend running `take latest from PRD` before promoting any new PRD-derived rule.
