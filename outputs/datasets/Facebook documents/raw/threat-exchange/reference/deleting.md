# Delete Data

ThreatExchange currently supports deletion for [ThreatDescriptor](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/threat-descriptors) objects and relationships between [ThreatIndicator](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/threat-exchange/reference/apis/threat-indicator) objects. Some objects may also be given an expiration time, which will cause data to be deleted automatically within 90 days of the expiration.


You can delete a ThreatDescriptor using the API with a `DELETE HTTP` request:

```code
DELETE https://graph.facebook.com/v2.11/<object_id>
```

After a subjective ThreatDescriptor is deleted, the objective ThreatIndicator may still exist.

To delete a relationship between ThreatIndicators using the API:

```code
DELETE https://graph.facebook.com/v2.11/<object_id>/related?related_id=<object_id_2>
```

We do not support deletes for Tags.
